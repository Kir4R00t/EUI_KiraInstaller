# This is an installer for Expanded UI mod for Civilization V
## [Download here](https://github.com/Kir4R00t/EUI_KiraInstaller/raw/main/EUI_KiraInstaller.zip)
I built it using python and tkinter for the GUI. It uses EUI version 1.29i.
To use it just unpack the zip and run the .exe file.

_NOTE: Windows defender may be triggered so I suggest turning it off before unpacking the zip._
